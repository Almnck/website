Herewith be the provisional Code of the Almnck Website:

1. We eats our own dogfood, yarr.
2. If two varmints approve, and the tests pass, it's pushed to the live site.
3. If you breaks it, you fixes it. But if you didn't break it, you can fix it anyway.
4. If you're bored, build more automatic tests.
5. We love linters, especially linters for humans -- grammar checkers, etc.
6. If a link breaks, after a month, we shift it to point to the IA or some other backup.
